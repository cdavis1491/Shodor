How to run GalaxSee

GalaxSee is designed to be run from a command line unix prompt. It solves 
for the collapse of a rotating group of objects bound by gravity. You can 
specify the number of masses, the mass per object, the running time for 
the model, and whether or not to visualize the results.

It is designed to be run as an MPI program. Typically you would run the 
program with a command such as:

  $ mpirun -np 4 -machinefile ./machines GalaxSee 1000 200 1000 1

for a 4 node cluster with a machines file specified in the local directory, 
running 1000 objects of 200 solar masses each for 1000 Myears, displaying the 
results in an X window.
